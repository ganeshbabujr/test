<h3>1. PL/SQL ?</h3>
	
<p>PL/SQL is a Procedural Language which is Extension to SQL.
Where we group SQL and PL/SQL statements into single Blocks and send for Execution in a single go.</p>
	
<h4>Advantages:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Reduce Network Traffic</li>
<li>Error Handling</li>
<li>Conditional Checking, Branching and Looping.</li>
<li>High Performance</li>
<li>High Productivity</li>
<li>Portabality</li>
<li>Scalability</li>
<li>Managebility</li>
<li>It Support Object Oriented Programming (OOP s)</li>
</ol>

<h3>2. Anonomous Block?</h3>

<pre><code class="language-sql">
DECLARE			-- Optional
BEGIN			-- Mandatory
EXCEPTION		-- Optional
END;			-- Mandatory
/		
	
* Unnamed Block 
* Anonymous Block
* Not Stored in database 
* One Time only Procedure
</code></pre>

<br><hr>

<h3>3. Diff between %TYPE 	& %ROWTYPE ?</h3>
<ol>
<li>%TYPE 	- It is used to declares a variable with the same data type as a table column | Limited to individual columns</li>
<li>%ROWTYPE	- Declares a record with the same structure as a table row (all columns)used to store 1 row of data</li>
</ol>

<br><hr>

<h3>4. Which Column mostly used in where clause for restriction.</h3>
	
<p>Primary Key.</p>

    <hr>

<h3>5. Cusor?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Cursor is used to Process Multiple Records in PL/SQL.</li>
<li>When SQL statement is Processed Oracle creates a Temporary Memory area called Context Area (Private Area)</li>
<li>Cursor is Pointing to that Area Where the Query get Passed and Executed</li>
<li>Cursor contains information on SELECT statement and row of data accessed by it.</li>
<li>The set of rows that cursor hold is called Active Set.</li>
</ul>	


<p>--exact fetch returns more than requested number of rows</p>

<hr>

<li>Fetch till the Cursor NOTFOUND (Exit Condition).</li>
<li>Close the Cursor.</li> 
</ul>
<br><hr>

<h3>8. Implicit Cursor?</h3>

<li>Default Name : SQL</li>
</ul>
<hr>


<h3>9. Explicit Cursor?</h3>

Procedure/function 
3. Cannot return to client							Ref curosr can Return to client 
4. cursor can be defined in PACKAGE					ref curosr cannot define outside of procedure / function 
and can access globally across package

<h3>-- stats_gather</h3>

	If DML operation is performed frequently in a Table Oracle Automatically Gather Statistics for that Table
	If the Table is Not Performed any DML Operations  frequently we can gather statistics to improve the performance.

	Stats gatherering is the process of collection information about the data in the database
	This information is used by the Optimizer to choose best execution plan.

<h3>4.Have u design the work by yourself or any support u will get.</h3>

In many of my projects, I have designed the work independently, 
especially when customizing PL/SQL queries and implementing backend solutions for applications. 
However, I also worked closely with cross-functional teams, such as frontend developers 
and business analysts, to ensure that my design met both technical and business needs. 
While I may have taken the lead on certain tasks, I recognize the importance of collaboration 
and often seek support for areas where additional expertise is needed.

in front end screen we have process button whenever we click the process button 
it run the procedure and delete the entires in pre order table some rare scenario 
the delete not happening as a plsql developer how will you fix it and how to avoid this in future.</h3>

1. Will check the Exception Handling is properly raised and handled and create and log table and 
	trap the error log message.
2. will check the Delete satatement is properly written in WHERE clause and commit or rollback.
3. We can check if there is any Foreign key integrety constraints voilated.
4. Will check the table lock either the other session is accessing the table at the 
	time of deletion.  i.e V$LOCK  | V$SESSION | SELECT * FROM v$locked_object.
   otherwise we can use Explicit lock using for UPDATE OF and WHERE CURRENT OF using cursor.
5. if the problem with the code i try to debug the code using dbms_output.put_line 
	before and after delete statement or DBMS_PROFILER or DBMS_TRACE for debugging.
6. will check there is any TRIGGER for that table is fired before the delete operation.
7. will test the delete statement seperately outside of the procedure.
8. To avoid this issue in future we can handle the exception and error log table for audit and debug.
9. we can use the DELETE statement as seperate session using PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS TRANSACTION.
10. we can unit test for all possible scenarios.
11. we can check performance load test if the procedure can handle excepted volume of data
	if the table is large we can use partitioning for that table. 

<hr>

<h3>12. we can use FORALL for bulk processing.</h3>

2. Initially i check the dependencies of Table A either there is any other table has dependency.
	using user_dependencies.

<h3>-- we have order screen has multiple queries how will you check that particular query is slow?</h3>

1. initially i check the SQL trace using i.e ALTER SESSION SET SQL_TRACE = TRUE;
2. using V$SQL and V$SQLAREA to see currently executing and recently executed SQL statements.
3. using performance Tuning method we can improve the query.
